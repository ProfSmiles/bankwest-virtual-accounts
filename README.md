# Bankwest Virtual Accounts Chrome extension
Add "virtual accounts" to your Bankwest online banking to help you save by allowing you to put money away for specific purposes. Got a car service coming up? Create a new account called "Car service" and put the date of the service in the notes to let you save towards it and make sure the money isn't accidentally used on something else.

Make sure you have enough put aside for the next round of bills, or just ensure your weekend adventures don't break the budget!

Get it on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bankwest-virtual-accounts/gilbnnlfdodjcockjpiafnepgfbdajag).

This extension only requests access to the domain `https://ibs.bankwest.com.au/` and only runs scripts on the account balances page. However, as this extension does run on a banking website, we strongly suggest you don't take our word for it and inspect the source code yourself. Have a look through this repository, and if you see something you could improve, feel free to make a pull request!
